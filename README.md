# Heart_Attack_Possibility


Hello,

Welcome to the README file for my "Heart Attack Possibility Project".


___________________________
## Abstract
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no/less chance of heart attack and 1 = more chance of heart attack


____________________________
## Goal
Create a classification model to predict whether or not a patient has a greater chance of having a heart attack.
